**Entry 07 - Final thoughts**

So, now that the course is over, I will write a blog post to reflect on how I think things went, and my thoughts on the course.

Starting off, I started this course with a very small knowledge and experience with Javascript and web development over-all, which made me a bit nervous thinking about how I would get through it. The course structure seemed very different and interesting though, and in the end I thought it was really fun to study in a quite different way than what I was used to.
While I haven't done nearly as much as what others have done if you just look at pure quantity, I personally feel like I learned many things during the course! I feel like I got more intuitive when it came to the code structure, and the Skype conversations with David really helped a lot. Not only did he come with great ideas, but also helped me get past any bump I ran into, which usually resulted in me not only getting past that issue but made me think of many new things to add and change. (Until I ran into new problems.. Obviously.)

At the beginning, I actually didn't even think I'd get as far as my little Whack-a-Mole game got, so I am quite pleased with the outcome! (David didn't only help with solving problems and giving feedback, but also by providing gory effects for my game.. Who would have thought!)
As final words, I wish I had put a bit more effort into posting blogs, and doing pull requests - just over-all being more active in the course and with the other students. I love how different the structure of the course is, but there was simply a whole lot going on besides this course for me which might have added to me not being as active as I could have been.

Anyway, thanks for teaching me a whole bunch of new stuff!
